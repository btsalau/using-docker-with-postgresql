We will use Containerisation and Python scripts to set up the extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) of a .csv into a Postgres database. Containers will be used to run our Python scripts and create a Postgres environment for handling our ETL scripts and database respectively. The Python scripts will use Pandas and SQLAlchemy libraries to handle the ETL process of the .csv file into a Postgres database.
